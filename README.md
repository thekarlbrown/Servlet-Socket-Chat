-- Servlet Socket Chat --

I am programming a chat tool that will use Java, servlets and a tomcat server to power a simple chatroom via WebSockets. 
The clients will be coded in HTML/CSS+JS and Android.
This is primarily a learning experience, although depending on how pretty it turns out I may add it to my website!
